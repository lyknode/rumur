-- This tests for a regression of a problem first observed on commit
-- 4944427734628cf913e8d5eeb54d897033f9eb59. When state variables should have
-- been reordered during optimisation, they were not. If this bug has been
-- reintroduced, the debug output will incorrectly list:
--
--   * field y is located at state offset 30 bits
--   * field x is located at state offset 0 bits

type
  t: scalarset(10);

var
  -- this field has a width of 30 bits in generated code and should get
  -- automatically reordered to come after the second field...
  x: array[t] of 0 .. 5;

  -- ...that has a width of 2 bits — a power of two — and hence should come
  -- first
  y: boolean;
